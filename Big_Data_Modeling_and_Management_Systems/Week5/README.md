# Big Data Management: The "M" in DBMS

Managing big data requires a different approach to database management systems because of the wide variation in data structure which does not lend itself to traditional DBMSs. There are many applications available to help with big data management. In these lessons we introduce you to some of these applications and provide insight into how and when they might be appropriate for your own big data management challenges.
