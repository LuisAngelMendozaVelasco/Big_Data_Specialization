# Foundations for Big Data Systems and Programming

Big Data requires new programming frameworks and systems. For this course, we don't programming knowledge or experience -- but we do want to give you a grounding in some of the key concepts.

# Systems: Getting Started with Hadoop

Let's look at some details of Hadoop and MapReduce. Then we'll go "hands on" and actually perform a simple MapReduce task in the Cloudera VM. Pay attention - as we'll guide you in "learning by doing" in diagramming a MapReduce task as a Peer Review.
