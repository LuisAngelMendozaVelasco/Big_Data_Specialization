# Practice with PySpark MLlib Clustering

This Reading provides links to the resources you will need to complete the Week 3 peer review assignment. [Browse to the Github repository](https://github.com/words-sdsc/courseraDataSimulation/tree/master/capstone/readings) to download all of the documents needed for this assignment. 

These documents include an [iPython Notebook](https://github.com/words-sdsc/courseraDataSimulation/blob/master/capstone/readings/Week%203%20pySpark%20ML%20Clustering.ipynb) with detailed instructions for completing the tasks, including the python commands you will need. 

To run these commands in the Cloudera VM, you will first need to run the setup script: [setupWeek3.sh](https://github.com/words-sdsc/courseraDataSimulation/blob/master/capstone/readings/setupWeek3.sh)

Then open PySpark in the VM with the following command: pyspark --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.5.0

You can then copy and paste the commands from the iPython notebook into PySpark.

If you prefer a PDF instead of using the iPython notebook, you may click the link below to download a PDF with the same instructions on how to work with the simulated game data in PySpark. After you complete the tasks for this ready, you will be asked to replicate the process, but you will be choosing your own attributes for the clustering to identify other actionable suggestions for Eglence Inc.
