# Computing Platforms for Graph Analytics

In the last two modules we have learned about graph analytics and graph data management. This week we will study how they come together. There are programming models and software frameworks created specifically for graph analytics. In this module we'll give an introductory tour of these models and frameworks. We will learn to implement what you learned in Week 2 and build on it using GraphX and Giraph.
