# Welcome to Big Data Integration and Processing

Welcome to the third course in the Big Data Specialization. This week you will be introduced to basic concepts in big data integration and processing. You will be guided through installing the Cloudera VM, downloading the data sets to be used for this course, and learning how to run the Jupyter server.

## Learning Objectives

- Summarize After this module you will be able to summarize the role of big data modeling and management as a precursor to integration and processing.
- Describe You will be able to describe the basic concepts in big data integration and processing.
- Prepare You will be able to download, install, and run the Cloudera VM, the required data sets, and the Jupyter Notebooks for this course.
