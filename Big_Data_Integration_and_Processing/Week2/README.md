# Retrieving Big Data (Part 2)

This module covers the various aspects of data retrieval for NoSQL data, as well as data aggregation and working with data frames. You will be introduced to MongoDB and Aerospike, and you will learn how to use Pandas to retrieve data from them.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe Learners will gain an understanding of NoSQL data retrieval issues, including aggregation, querying, and data frames.
- Demonstrate Learners will be able to demonstrate a practical understanding of the MongoDB and Aerospike as well as the Pandas analytics tool.
