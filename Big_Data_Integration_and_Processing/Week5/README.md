# Big Data Analytics using Spark

In this module, you will go deeper into big data processing by learning the inner workings of the Spark Core. You will be introduced to two key tools in the Spark toolkit: Spark MLlib and GraphX.

## Learning Objectives

- Discuss Learners will be able to discuss the advantages of Resilient Distributed Datasets and the role they play in Spark Transformations.
- Summarize Learners will be able to summarize the features and explain the advantages of Spark MLlib and GraphX.
- Practice Learners will gain a practical understanding of Spark Streaming.
