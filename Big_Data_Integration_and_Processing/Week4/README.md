# Processing Big Data

This module introduces Learners to big data pipelines and workflows as well as processing and analysis of big data using Apache Spark.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe Learners will be able to describe components of big data pipelines and workflows.
- Recommend Learners will be able to evaluate big data processing challenges and recommend appropriate solutions.
- Demonstrate Learners will be able to demonstrate practical applications of the Spark analytics toolkilt.
